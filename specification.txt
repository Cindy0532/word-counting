1. word split--function of words:

Concept Definition:

char == [CHAR] (CHAR is defined as all characters)
blank == [space, line break, tab]
	
TEXT == seq char 
(seq is a predefined function, meaning a sequence of elements from its set-type argument) 
SPACE == seq1 blank 
WORD == seq1 (char \ blank)

Note: TEXT includes the empty sequence, but SPACE and WORD must have at least one character, so we declare them to be seq1 (non-empty sequences).

Requirement of function words:

words: TEXT -> seq WORD 
	 	 
\forall s: SPACE; w: WORD; l,r: TEXT 
    	words  <> = <> &
    	words  s = <> &
    	words  w = < w > &
    	words (sr) = words r &
    	words (ls) = words l &
    	words (lsr) = words l + words r

2. word count -- function of wc:

Requirement of function wc:

wc: TEXT -> N 	 
 
\forall file: TEXT
 
wc file = # (words file)
